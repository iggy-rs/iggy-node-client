## iggy node.js client

iggy node.js client for [iggy-rs](https://iggy.rs/)'s binary protocol, written in typescript. it currently only support tcp & tls transports.

diclaimer: although all iggy commands & basic client/stream are implemented this is still a WIP, provided as is, and has still a long way to go to be considered "battle tested".

note: This lib started as _iggy-bin_ ( [github](https://github.com/T1B0/iggy-bin) / [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iggy-bin)) before migrating under iggy-rs org. package iggy-bin@v1.3.4 is equivalent to @iggy.rs/sdk@v1.0.3


note: previous works on node.js http client has been moved to [iggy-node-http-client](<https://github.com/iggy-rs/iggy-node-http-client) (moved on 04 July 2024)
